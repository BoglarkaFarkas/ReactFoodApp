# ReactFoodApp

This is a simple web application where users can search for individual dishes, find out what ingredients are needed to prepare a specific dish, and view the recipe itself. The application is built using the Spoonacular API. It was developed based on the following course as a reference: [Code Stoic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHn66JJH5zs&list=PLSsAz5wf2lkK_ekd0J__44KG6QoXetZza&index=1&ab_channel=CodeStoic)  
If you want to try out the application, you'll need the following command: npm run dev. To try out the website, you need to register on the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard) website and use the API key in the code where it says "Your API key."  
The application looks like this:
